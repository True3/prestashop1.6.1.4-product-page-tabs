# prestashop 1.6.1.4 product page tabs

This is default theme product.tpl modifyed to display tabs + CSS to make them look better.
You will have to modify CSS colors etc. to fit your theme. I hide titles of tabs content in CSS, unhide if needed.

Also you'll have to translate "Reviews" word from Translations > YourTheme inside Prestashop Back-End.
