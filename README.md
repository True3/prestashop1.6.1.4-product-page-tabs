# prestashop 1.6.1.4 product page tabs

Article is here: http://www.fix-css.com/2016/01/bring-back-prestashop-product-page-dynamic-tabs-in-default-theme-for-v-1-6-1-4/

This is default theme product.tpl modified to display tabs + CSS to make them look better.
You will have to modify CSS colors etc. to fit your theme. I hide titles of tabs content in CSS, unhide if needed.

Also you'll have to translate "Reviews" word from Translations > YourTheme inside Prestashop Back-End.
